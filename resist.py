        Project 2025 is a conservative policy blueprint developed by The Heritage Foundation 
        and its partners. It outlines a comprehensive agenda for the executive branch, 
        focusing on dismantling what it calls the "administrative state" and implementing 
        conservative policies across government agencies.
        
        This application analyzes how congressional voting records align with Project 2025 
        policy positions and connects this information with campaign finance data to identify 
        potential correlations between donor interests and policy alignment.

        1. **Congress.gov** - For bill information and voting records

        The alignment analysis is performed by comparing voting records with Project 2025 policy positions.
